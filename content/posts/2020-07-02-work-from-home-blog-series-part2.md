Today almost after the lockdown, I ve tried both the scenarios namely work from home and work from office almost equally. 



Definitely both have major differences in terms of the productivity, coordination and work-life balance.





Remote working is very common in the technology space and it's something which is not new. Still a lot of IT and technology companies have offices as workplace. 



Ever wondered why? I mean why do they need offices if they can use technology to make it work from home.



The answer lies in another question, why do we need separate room for sleeping, eating, cooking, watching TV, meeting guests and a lot more. Being an engineer, it's an easy task to imagine that every thing is designed for a purpose. Our houses are not designed or architectured to suit the additional need of a workspace. House is the common space for all the family members with a different privileges. 

Every section of your house associate with a different habit or behaviour of our mind or body. For example if you are in the dining area, you’ll feel Hungary or crave for the food. If you are in the TV room, you’’ll end up watching TV. 





I worked from home almost 18 months pre-2020, 2020, I shifted to a new office nearby my place. During this transition, lockdown happened and I switched back to work from home after almost a  months of work from office scenario for 70 odd days. This transition and switching back-n-forth gave me good enough inside to write an article on this whole experience. In the current series, this is the second post, the first post itself was an indicator that it's going to be an exciting journey.



So working from a personal office vs work from home has definitely huge advantages. Specially if you are running your own business, building a startup or its your own commercial space. 



However in the current scenario where every organisation is seeking remote working solution for their teams and staffs. Its going to be challenging on how will they will be able to ensure the quality of their product and services while being able to work on a remote environment.
