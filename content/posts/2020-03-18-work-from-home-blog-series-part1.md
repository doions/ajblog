# Work From Home: The world is seeking the solution to solve this problem.

## What's the exact problem faced by the businesses these days?

How to get the productivity from their teams across the world working from home or anywhere.

## Why this is a major problem for many corporations?

Because 

1. systems and processes are not ready for this kind of situation.
2. The employees are not ready to work in this new environment
3. The security of the information and intellectual property is at risk

And many more yet to be discovered post COVID-19.(Will be covered in the series later in detail)

## What are the possible solutions?

The possible steps/solution are as follows

1. Bring the right tools

2. Train teams to use those tools

3. Bring the right processes in place to ensure the collaboration and commitment towards delivery of the work

4. Bring discipline

5. Adjust timezones and local complexities of each and every worker

6. Ownership agreements around the creative work.



I am currently writing more on it. As I am dealing with more clients trying to solve the problem using technology, processes and of course people.



As I get detailed insight about the problem. i'll try to share it with my readers here.
