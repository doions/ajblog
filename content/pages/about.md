This is my personal website, apart from being an entrepreneur, I am also an internet geek, traveller and storyteller. I wish to be a blogger, an awesome designer, digital media marketing expert, active open source contributor/developer and if at all possible, a photographer as well.

I am a qualified computer scientist as well as an engineer by education, I love data science, machine learning and blockchain. I jumped into entrepreneurship during my college days (2003) and I founded MindsArray. A technology startup to help educational institutes to provide better learning results. 
Later, I build Pay1, an internet, mobile product with a nation-wide network of users (neighbourhood retail stores ) in India. It is a pretty solid platform for shop owners to do business for the past 9 years.

MindsArray was my academic project which later turned into a startup and finally a corporate organization with 250+ team-size and 50K+ active partner base (Till I was the CEO - Nov 2017).

I am passionate about building new products, which are useful in our day to day life and they solve some real-world problem. In the same journey, I am using my skills and passion to build more products in my new startup. Every startup journey has certain stages and this new startup is going through its stages of ideation, validation, market research and a lot more.

This place will try to communicate with the world about my experience and the journey. I must say, I am privileged to experience it. Iâ€™ll try to communicate with the users of my future products and collect feedback through this website.
